This React component has a subtle bug related to how it handles asynchronous operations and updates to its state.  The `fetchUserData` function fetches user data from an API.  However, the `setState` call inside the `then` block might not update the component correctly if the component unmounts before the promise resolves, leading to a potential error.  This is a classic race condition problem in asynchronous React components.
